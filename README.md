## Menubar-notes

I needed a fast, accessible way to jot down notes. The default Mac Notes app was slow, and the available options were either missing features or required payment, so I decided to build my own.

Menubar-notes is built using Electron for a seamless desktop experience, with React and Vite powering a fast, modern development environment. To offer a rich text editing experience, I've integrated Quill.js, enabling powerful and flexible note formatting.

### Features
- **Quick Access:** Jot down notes directly from your menu bar.
- **Rich Text Editing:** Leverage Quill.js for advanced text formatting.
- **Cross-Platform:** Built with Electron to run on multiple operating systems.
- **Fast & Modern:** Utilizes React with Vite for a responsive, efficient app.
